# Easybank-landing-page

Thuis challenge was very fun and gave me more experience creating and laying out webpages. 

One part i found very challenging was the positioning of the phones image on the home page as when offset to the right using right: -120px 
this was leaving white space and overflowing causing a gap on the right hand side of the page. I attempted many different solutions like Z-index,
placing the image in a div and setting a width, clip-path and many other differnt things. It ended up being solved using transform: translate-x. 

Overall very happy with how this one turned out. Still think i could use more practice with responsive design. Maybe try designing for mobile first and then desktop.

Thank you.
